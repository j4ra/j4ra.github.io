So I decided to start a new blog. In this blog I would like to share my knowledge about Unity3D programming. Especially some neat techniques I tried to develop in my free time. This would involve shader programming and C#.

I would also like to post some interesting information about various physics topics. I currently study physics at Charles University in Prague and some parts of physics are very interesting. This would involve special relativity, general relativity and a little bit of quantum mechanics.

However, my first blogpost will be about jekyll and how I created this site, how I added the LaTeX to MathML converter and many more
